## 🖥️ About

Win95-HK is a web application that reimagines the classic Windows 95 operating system with influences from Hong Kong's unique style and culture. This project is a personal tribute to my first PC experience - a Windows 95 computer my dad bought and taught me to use as a child.

The application combines the nostalgic elements of Windows 95's interface with neon colors, Traditional Chinese typography, and visual elements inspired by Hong Kong's unique urban landscape.
